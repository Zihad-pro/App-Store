Live demo: https://appstore-3c7a0.web.app/

App Store is a React-based web application that mimics a mobile app store (like the Google Play Store). Users can browse apps, view details, and (optionally) perform actions like authentication, add reviews or favorites. The project uses Firebase for backend services and React Router for client-side routing.

This repo was built with the goal of learning and demonstrating a modern React + Firebase app with real-world features.
